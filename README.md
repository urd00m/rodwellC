It appears that jumping in and out of a loop in fortran in C have the same behavior
The only difference is that fortran at the end of loop for i give its the value 
* whereas C will just contine the i++ and will continue to increment i, but 
other than that they have the same behavior 

This means the error in the main.c is in some other part of the code, 
Lembeck uses new variables and has a lot of messy labels.
